## Prioridades de este producto
1. Ningún cliente puede ver datos de otro (RLS por organización, probado).
2. Ningún secreto en el repositorio ni en los registros.
3. Datos personales: solo los necesarios, con opción de baja y borrado (Ley 1581 de 2012).
4. JARVIS y el producto no comparten base de datos, usuarios ni llaves.


## Reglas del Taller (siempre)
- Lee primero `CLAUDE.md` y `docs/blueprint.md` de este repositorio; trabaja solo en el paso que te asignó el Jefe de obra.
- Stack del producto: **Python 3.12 + FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX + Tailwind + Chart.js**, datos en **su propio proyecto de Supabase** (Postgres, Auth con enlace mágico, RLS por organización). Nada de Next.js ni de tablas de JARVIS.
- Nunca escribas secretos en el código: van en `.env` (que no se sube) y `.env.example` lleva solo los nombres.
- Al terminar, corre el comando de verificación del paso y reporta en 5 líneas: qué hiciste, archivos tocados, resultado de la verificación.
